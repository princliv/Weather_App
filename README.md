# Weather App Project

This repository contains a simple **Weather App** designed to provide weather information for a given location. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes a third-party API to fetch weather data. Users can enter a location in the search bar, and the app will display the current weather conditions for that location.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can input a location in the search bar and click the search button to retrieve weather data for that location.
- **Real-time Weather Data:** The app fetches real-time weather data from a weather API to display current temperature, description, humidity, and wind information.
- **Responsive Design:** The app's interface is designed to be responsive and suitable for various screen sizes.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the Weather App, including the search bar, weather details, and placeholders for data.
- `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS styles that define the look and feel of the app's user interface.
- `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for fetching weather data from the API and updating the app's content dynamically.
- `README.md`: This file (the one you're reading) provides information about the project, its features, and how to set it up.

## Getting Started

To run the Weather App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git

2. Open the project folder using a code editor of your choice.

3. Customize the app (if needed):
- You can modify the `index.html` file to change the structure of the app's components.
- Adjust styles in the `styles.css` file to customize the app's appearance.

4. Obtain an API key:
- This Weather App uses a weather API to fetch weather data. You need to sign up for an API key from a weather data provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

5. Update the API Key:
- In the `script.js` file, find the place where the API key is used for making API requests. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key.

6. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or serve it using a local server to see the Weather App in action.
